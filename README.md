# Goose Prank Downloader

This project is an add-on for the software developed by [@samnchiet](https://x.com/samnchiet) on X. 

The main page of his program --> [https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose](https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose)

My addition is a python module that automate the execution of this program into the startup of windows machines and execute it with a random number of instances.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/juanjolopez19/goose
or
# You may have to adjust the release
pip install https://github.com/JuanjoLopez19/Goose/releases/download/Prank/goose_prank_downloader-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
## Usage
My idea was to make an autoexecutable python module but I guess that idea is kind of a security breach and python don't allow me to do it
So my solution was after installing the module (succesfully) run in a terminal the following line of code:
```bash
python -c "from goose.app import run;run()"
```

And just make fun of your geek friends
